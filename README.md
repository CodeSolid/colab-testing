# HuggingFace course
This repo contains some exploratory notebooks and code which (at this point) is mainly based on the [Hugging Face LLM Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1).

To print requirements (e.g. to update requirements.txt):

```
pipdeptree --python .venv/bin/python -d 0
```

Currently using Python 3.12.10.  Tensorflow not yet ready for later 3.13 versions.
